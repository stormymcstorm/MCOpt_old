# MCOpt

## Demos and Experiments
There are a few demos and experiments included in this repo. They all depend on
morse complex data located in `gen_complexes`. 

If you have [ttk](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/) installed you can generate
these complexes yourself by running
```
python gen.py
```
Alternatively you can retrieve the data from [here](https://github.com/stormymcstorm/MCOpt/releases/download/v0.4.0/gen_complexes.zip).

There is also a devcontainer available in this repo that has [ttk](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/)
installed.
